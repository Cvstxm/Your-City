# Your-City
Welcome, it's my first project(game) in C++.
In Poland we call on this game "Pa≈Ñstwa, Miasta".

Fristable please put, a number of players. To play this game we need minimum 2 players and maximum 4 players.
Next the game draw, a category for exmaple: Country, Thing, Animal, City...
The same but game draw, a letter of category. After drawing we have, a 15 seconds and when time is end players must put buttons:

Player 1: 'q'
Player 2: 'w'
Player 3: 'e'
Player 4: 'r'

Next game give, a question about answers, which player said. Other player check the answer and if is good click 'T', when bad click 'N'.
If answer is good, game add 10 points to player, which pushed the button.
Game drawing again even the answer is bad.
The game win player, which first have a 100 points.

Sorry for only polish language but I was not sure for share this on gitHub.
